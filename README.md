# Phase 4 Project: Family Album

This is an application that allows users to post their family photos and share with their family. Users can post photos and leave comments.

This application was created with a react front end and ruby and rails back end.

## Background

It is not easy to share every moment of your children's growth with your family. Especially if your family lives far away or even outside the country which is my case. I used to send my family many pictures and videos by text which was not ideal. So for my phase 4 project, I came up with this Family Album app that I can post my child's pictures anytime without bothering my family by many text notifications and they can check the pictures whenever they want to.
